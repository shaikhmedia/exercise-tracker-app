# Exercise Tracker App

This app is built on a freeCodeCamp Mern tutorial. Though the functionalities and ideas are identical, there is a big difference in terms of the actual codes. Here are things you can do with this app

- Add an user
- Add an exercise (with type, duration and time)
- Edit an exercise 
- Delete and exercise

### This app is built with MERN stack. Exact technologies used are as follows: 
- MongoDB as database 
- Express as node framework
- React to develop the frontend of the app
- And node as the server runtime

Along with these, I have used react hooks to manage the states and side effects. All the codes in this app is well commented to better understanding of the process.
